# Portfolio Website 2 (Node.js)

This is my second — but first fully completed — portfolio project, finished on April 14, 2025.
It’s a multilingual Node.js website featuring five main pages and several legal pages. The site includes automatic language redirection based on the user's system language.

All content is rendered dynamically via a single interface.html using JavaScript.

**Features include**:
- Filter systems for skills, links, and projects
- Responsive mobile navigation with a custom footer bar
- Various hover effects and interactive UI elements and more
